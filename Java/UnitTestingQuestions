Unit Testing vs Integration Testing
Unit Testing is a kind of white box testing, whereas Integration Testing is a kind of black-box testing. For Unit Testing,
accessibility of code is required, as it tests the written code, while for Integration Testing, access to code is not
required, since it tests the interactions and interfaces between modules.

What is Test Driven Development in Agile?
TDD is an agile development methodology where tests are written before the code is developed. In contrast,
traditional testing is performed after the code is written.

Why TDD is not usually used?
This means the following problems in such a TDD approach: More test code than the implementation code.
Not easy to design tests before the implementation is done. Implementation refactoring breaks existing tests.
