What is DataBase
In computing, a database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. Small databases can be
stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage.

DBMS
DBMS is a collection of programs that facilitates users to create and maintain a database. In other words, DBMS provides
us an interface or tool for performing different operations such as the creation of a database, inserting data into it,
deleting data from it, updating the data, etc.

Advantages of DBMS
Authorization, reduces complexity, provides backup and recovery, data consistency.

Checkpoint in DBMS
The Checkpoint is a type of mechanism where all the previous logs are removed from the system and permanently stored
in the storage disk.

RDBMS
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management Systems. It is used to maintain the data records and indices in tables.
RDBMS is the form of DBMS which uses the structure to identify and access data concerning the other piece of data in
the database. RDBMS is the system that enables you to perform different operations such as- update, insert, delete,
manipulate and administer a relational database with minimal difficulties.

Types of Database Language
Data Definition Language (DDL) e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME, etc. All these commands are used for updating
the data that's why they are known as Data Definition Language.

Data Manipulation Language (DML) e.g., SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, etc. These commands are used for the manipulation
of already updated data that's why they are the part of Data Manipulation Language.

DATA Control Language (DCL) e.g., GRANT and REVOKE. These commands are used for giving and removing the user access on
the database. So, they are the part of Data Control Language.

Transaction Control Language (TCL) e.g., COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT. These are the commands used for managing
transactions in the database. TCL is used for managing the changes made by DML.

ACID Properties

ATOMICITY: Atomicity is more generally known as ?all or nothing rule.' Which implies all are considered as one unit, and
they either run to completion or not executed at all.

CONSISTENCY: This property refers to the uniformity of the data. Consistency implies that the database is consistent before
and after the transaction.

ISOLATION: This property states that the number of the transaction can be executed concurrently without leading to the
inconsistency of the database state.

DURABILITY: This property ensures that once the transaction is committed it will be stored in the non-volatile memory
and system crash can also not affect it anymore.

Keys
Primary key: The Primary key is an attribute in a table that can uniquely identify each record in a table. It is
compulsory for every table.

Candidate key: The Candidate key is an attribute or set of an attribute which can uniquely identify a tuple. The Primary
key can be selected from these attributes.

Super key: The Super key is a set of attributes which can uniquely identify a tuple. Super key is a superset of the
candidate key.

Foreign key: The Foreign key is a primary key from one table, which has a relationship with another table.
It acts as a cross-reference between tables.
